## Contentment for Umbraco

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a state of happiness and satisfaction

### What is it?

This is a collection of Umbraco components that I have developed for use on my own **Umbraco** implementation projects.

Some components may be innovative, others may be a reimagining of existing components, property-editors, features and other community packages.


#### Why should I use it?

I'm sharing my code with the world. It is your choice (and responsibility) whether you would like to use it.
No pressure or marketing spin from me.


#### What's on offer?

Let's take a look inside...

##### Property Editors

- [Bytes](../docs/editors/bytes.md) - a read-only label to display file sizes in relative bytes.
- [Code Editor](../docs/editors/code-editor.md) - a code snippet editor, _(using the ACE library that is bundled with Umbraco)._
- [Content Blocks](../docs/editors/content-blocks.md) - a block editor, configurable using element types.
- [Data List](../docs/editors/data-list.md) - an editor that combines a custom data source with a custom list editor.
- [Data Picker](../docs/editors/data-picker.md) - advanced picker editor to query a custom data source.
- [Editor Notes](../docs/editors/editor-notes.md) - Similar to [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md), with enhanced UI options.
- [Icon Picker](../docs/editors/icon-picker.md) - an editor to select an icon (from the Umbraco icon library).
- [List Items](../docs/editors/list-items.md) - an editor to manage items with a name, value, icon and description.
- [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md) - a read-only label to display rich-text instructional messages for content editors.
- [Number Input](../docs/editors/number-input.md) - a numeric editor, with sizing configurations.

- [Social Links](../docs/editors/social-links.md) - an editor to manage links for social network platforms.
- [Templated Label](../docs/editors/templated-label.md) - a display label, ideal for showing data from 3rd-party systems.
- [Textbox List](../docs/editors/textbox-list.md) - a multi-textstring editor, adds a textbox for each item in a custom data source.
- [Text Input](../docs/editors/text-input.md) - a textstring editor, configurable with HTML5 options.

#### Telemetry

Information about the [telemetry feature](../docs/telemetry.md).

#### Releases

Downloads are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases).

#### Installation

_**Please note...**_

- v4.x supports **Umbraco v8.17** (on .NET 4.7), **Umbraco v9.5** (on .NET 5.0 only), **Umbraco v10.0** (on .NET 6.0) and  **Umbraco v11.0** (on .NET 7.0), it will support those versions and above.
- v3.x supports **Umbraco v8.17.0** and **Umbraco v9.0.0**, it will work on latest Umbraco v8.x and v9.x releases.
- v2.x was developed against **Umbraco v8.14.0**, it will still work on latest Umbraco v8.x releases.
- v1.x was developed against **Umbraco v8.6.1**, it will still work on latest Umbraco v8.x releases.

With Contentment v3+ on Umbraco v9+ (.NET 5+), you can only install a package from the [NuGet package repository](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.Community.Contentment). For Umbraco v8.x, the package can still be installed from either [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/contentment/) or NuGet package repositories.

##### NuGet package repository

To [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.Contentment), you can run the following command from the `dotnet` CLI:

    dotnet add package Umbraco.Community.Contentment

> Please note, that the [`Umbraco.Community.Contentment`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.Contentment) NuGet package is a placeholder package for future releases, it contains a dependency on two other packages, [`Our.Umbraco.Community.Contentment`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.Community.Contentment) _(containing the web assets)_, and [`Our.Umbraco.Community.Contentment.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.Community.Contentment.Core/) _(containing the assembly code libraries)_.

##### Our Umbraco package repository

If you are using Umbraco v8.x, and prefer to install Contentment from the backoffice, the package can be downloaded from the Our Umbraco package repository:

> <https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/contentment/>


#### Demo website

[A demo website is available for testing purposes.](../src/Umbraco.Cms.10.0.0/README.md) _(Please note, you will need to clone the repository and run locally.)_


### Documentation

[Documentation for each of the components - with screenshots, use-cases and code examples](../docs/) - can be found in the `/docs` folder.

Please note, you may find other components within Contentment that have not yet been documented.<br>
_Let's call those "life's little surprises"._


#### Known issues

- **Compatibility with Umbraco v9 running .NET 6.0** (on Contentment v4)
  - Due to how the .NET multi-targeting support has been implemented in Contentment, if you are running Umbraco v9 on .NET 6.0 and want to install the Contentment package, you may experience an `NU1107: Version conflict detected` error. At present, the workarounds are to either upgrade to Umbraco v10, or use Contentment v3.x. If you have an alternative workaround suggestion, please do let me know. [See #223 for details.](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/issues/223) _(Note: v9 on .NET 5.0 is totally fine.)_

- **Data List**
  - When using the Umbraco Content data source with an XPath query, inside a Nested Content editor, it will not be able to identify the contextual containing node ID. e.g. your XPath query will not work. [See #30 for details.](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/issues/30)
  - When using the Umbraco Content data source with an XPath query that contains a `$` prefix parameter, the preview will not display the items. [See #120 for details.](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/issues/120)
  - With Umbraco v9 (Contentment v3), SQL data source does not support querying SQL CE. [See #172 for details.](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/issues/172)
  - With Umbraco v10 (Contentment v4), SQL data source does not support querying SQLite, _(yet!)_ [See #258 for details.](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/issues/258)

### Support

I've been doing open source for a long time. I have suffered my fair share of burnout and empathy fatigue.

I reserve the right to address bug reports or feature requests in my own time, or ignore them completely.

**Any feedback is welcome and appreciated.** But please keep in mind, I am not your personal support developer.

If you are really stuck, do remember that the Umbraco community is amongst the friendliest on our planet, learn to embrace it. 
Ask for help on the [Our Umbraco support forum](https://our.umbraco.com/), or the [Community Discord Channel](https://community.umbraco.com/get-involved/community-discord-channel/), I am sure someone can help you there.
